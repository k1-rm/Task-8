# Task-8
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for clustering analysis using the classic Iris dataset. It covers data loading, preprocessing with feature standardization, and unsupervised learning via the K-Means clustering algorithm. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method, and the clustering performance is evaluated using the Silhouette Score. For visualization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces the feature space to two dimensions, enabling intuitive 2D scatterplots of the resulting clusters. The implementation leverages Python libraries including pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib to deliver a clean, insightful clustering pipeline.
